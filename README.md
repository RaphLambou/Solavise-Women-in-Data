# Solavise-Women-in-Data
This repo contains all of the files on which I have worked on for the solavise women in data program

My key takeaways from our session on git and github are
1️⃣ Your GitHub account is more than just a profile — it’s your tech CV! It shows recruiters your projects, consistency, growth and familiarity with modern tool.
2️⃣ Every project should have a solid README file — it xplains your project, its purpose, and the technologies used, tells your story and helps others understand your work. 📄
